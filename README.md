I'm a software engineer with a broad background encompassing bioinformatics, neuroscience, neurophysiology and electrical engineering.

I write less hobby code nowadays because I currently spend my free time writing fiction, but I still dabble now and then. My most recent interest has been in embedded systems [1], [2] and in [VR].
